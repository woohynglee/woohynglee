## About Me
I'm currently a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania studying Finance, Statistics, and Data Science. My interests lie in leveraging data and technology to drive smarter, more informed financial decisions. Outside of academics, I'm into MMA, lifting, long-distance running (ran 1 full & 3 half marathons so far), reading, podcasts, and volunteering.

Feel free to reach out - I'm always down for a chat :)
